# DjangoWebsite

This is personal project for a social media network. It serves as a means for me to learn up creating a full stack application. I used the
django framework to set up the website and postgres as the database. The website is hosted on the railway app.

It has the following features:
posting 
commenting
profiles
following
liking

Currently it is deployed on https://djangowebsite-production-d797.up.railway.app/login/.
